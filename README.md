# Protein conformal retrieval

Code and notebooks from Functional protein mining with conformal guarantees (2024)

## Installation

`pip install -e .`

## Structure

- `./protein_conformal`: utility functions to creating confidence sets and assigning probabilities to any protein machine learning model for search
- `./scope`: experiments pertraining to SCOPe
- `./pfam`: notebooks demonstrating how to use our techniques to calibrate false discovery and false negative rates for different pfam classes
- `./ec`: experiments pertraining to EC number classification on uniprot
- `./data`: scripts and notebooks used to process data
- `./clean_selection`: scripts and notebooks used to process data
